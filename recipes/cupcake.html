        <h2>A REALLY Real Strawberry Cupcakes recipe</h2>
        <p>
            I've been messing around trying to make a perfect strawberry cupcake to go with the Real Strawberry Frosting I developed a couple of years ago. 
            It's been a long road and lots of cupcakes tested and tasted along the way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The trick was NOT using puree as I do when making the frosting. 
            Rather, grinding freeze-dried strawberries into a powder brought this cupcake recipe out of my test kitchen and into my recipe box! 
            I am so pleased with the results!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ ounces freeze-dried strawberries</li>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup cake flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>⅔ cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            <li>
                Line muffin tins with 20 cupcake liners (for mini cupcakes, line 72 mini muffin tins).
            </li>
            <li>
                Grind strawberries into a fine powder using a coffee grinder or food processor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk strawberry powder, all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat butter and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mixture should be noticeably lighter in color.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat in vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir flour mixture, alternately with the milk, into butter mixture until just incorporated. Fill lined tins with cupcake batter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven until cupcakes spring back when gently touched with a fingertip or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 
                16 to 18 minutes for regular cupcakes, 8 to 10 minutes for mini cupcakes.
            </li>
        </ol>
